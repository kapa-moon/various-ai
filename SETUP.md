This is a Next.js application for conducting AI chatbot experiments with a 2x2 design studying different conversation approaches.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env.local` file with:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_neon_database_url
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

3. **Initialize the database:**
   ```bash
   node scripts/init-db.js
   ```

4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open http://localhost:3000** in your browser

## üß™ Experiment Design

### Four AI Conditions (2x2 Design)

| | **Self-Clone/Monologue** | **Companion/Dialogue** |
|---|---|---|
| **Sycophantic** | Inner Cheerleader (Blue) | Supportive Friend (Pink) |
| **Antagonistic** | Tough Self-Critic (Green) | Reality Check Friend (Yellow) |

### Flow
1. **Home Page** - Welcome and start session
2. **Situation Description** - User describes their challenge
3. **Baseline Survey** - Pre-conversation measurements (3 items)
4. **AI Selection** - Choose from 4 colored bot options
5. **Chat Session** - 10-exchange conversation with selected AI
6. **Emotion Landscape** - Metaphoric journey mapping assessment
7. **Follow-up Survey** - Post-conversation measurements (3 items + open response)
8. **Completion** - Thank you page

- Example: "Come on, you know what I think? They might respect your honesty more than you think..."
